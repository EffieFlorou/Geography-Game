# Description 
I developed an interactive JavaScript project featuring an SVG map of Greece. Users are tasked with identifying specific regions by clicking on them. The color of the region changes based on the number of attempts made, offering visual feedback. The project also includes a timer and scoring system, making it both engaging and challenging.
